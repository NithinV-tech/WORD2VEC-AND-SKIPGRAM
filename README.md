How to Run
=========================
    -load train.csv and test.csv to this folder, both of them should stay in the same folder containing this readme

    -to any of the 4 files
        -python <filename.py> 
        -in place of  <filename.py>
            – build_svd.py: pre trained model for svd
            – build_skip.py: pre trained model for skipgram
            – downstream_svd.py: Used LSTM for evaluation
            – downstreat_skip.py: Used LSTM for evaluation

    

Assumptions
================
    -train.csv and test.csv is not included in folder, it must be provided
    - Hyper parameters used has been included in the report
**    
Model Link**
    - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xQ3xrQOvKBX0-KT0kwzIgFy2vWyFW2Su/view?usp=sharing
     (All the 4 models has been  saved there)

    NB: while developing the code, it was developed in a virtual environment.
